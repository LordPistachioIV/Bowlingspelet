Issues faced

UPDATE 1
Scoring.
When clicking the Bowl button both scores for player 1 and 2 would be the same. When using a breakpoint to debug the issue disappeared. 
Spent about 30 minutes trying to resolve this, found that my PC was running it too quickly after some searching online, resolved it by
adding "Using System.Threading" and "Thread.Sleep(50)" resolved this issue and now is working by giving different scores for each
player.
