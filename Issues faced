Issues faced

UPDATE 1
Scoring.
When clicking the Bowl button both scores for player 1 and 2 would be the same. When using a breakpoint to debug the issue disappeared. 
Spent about 30 minutes trying to resolve this, found that my PC was running it too quickly after some searching online, resolved it by
adding "Using System.Threading" and "Thread.Sleep(50)" resolved this issue and now is working by giving different scores for each
player.

UPDATE 2
Strikes.
Main issue with strikes is that you can have up to 3 strikes in a row, so for every round after 2 there will have to be 2 checks for
strikes to make sure that the maximum score (300 points, a strike every round with 3 on round 10). Working out the best way of doing this.
Currently the best idea to check for three strikes in a row (e.g. a strike every round up to the 3rd round) and have that check from 3rd
round to 10th round to avoid unnecessary code.

UPDATE 3
Strikes
I have sequential strikes working, an additional check in all checks for the sequential strike are in place and allow it to work up to
round 7 (calculated in round 9) as sequential strikes in round 8 and 9 depend on round 10. Round 10 is still causing some slight problems
as the way of scoring is different in it as apposed to rounds 1 - 9. Working on making it work as needed without having nested ifs inside
of nested ifs inside of nested ifs and so on. Current idea is: Round 10 with a do while so I can make sure that if there is a strike or 
a spare then the player can have the extra turn otherwise they don't get the extra beat.

UPDATE 4
Strikes and round 10
Sequential strikes were working but the original code broke the standard strikes, I have fixed this by changing the order of which the
checks are done. All strikes, sequential strikes and spares are working. Round 10 has all possibilities working.
